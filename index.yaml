    description: Fast, reliable, scalable, and easy to use open-source relational
      database system. MariaDB Server is intended for mission-critical, heavy-load
      production systems as well as for embedding into mass-deployed software. Highly
      available MariaDB cluster. This version is based on the bitnami chart but modified
      to use the offical MariaDb image, thus allowing the chart to now be multi-arch.
